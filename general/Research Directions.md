### Tiny Recursive Models 
Interesting research problem where tiny recursive models are able to outperform much larger models on things like ARC-AGI. TRM performs recursion on both a reasoning latent z and a prediction latent y.

**ARC is a vision problem**
Paper from a team at MIT who formulate ARC as a image-to-image mapping problem using ViT. Achieves very high performance using models which are very small (6M - 66M).

### Pipeline RL
Get better at understanding asynchronos RL pipelines. Could we overoptimize performance on a single node? Asynchronos RL, in-place weight updates, continous batching, ...
